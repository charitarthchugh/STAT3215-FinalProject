### The analysis to be replicated

The analysis that this paper covers assesses the on-time performance of domestic flights based on observations from the year 2016. We will recreate the multiple linear regression model. The paper also discusses the usage of a random tree and random forest model, but because this falls outside the scope of the course, we will only focus on the MLR model and how it can be improved. The objective of this model is to predict the on-time performance of flights based on an optimal set of predictors.

### How to recreate dataset used in the paper

We will focus on only the variables used in the original analysis. The data which is publicly available from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics has over 23 attributes, but for the sake of simplicity we have kept the eight regressors and the response variable of departure delay (`DepDelay`).

The dataset used in the original paper utilizes a subset of the attributes provided from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. They have cleaned and pre-processed the dataset but have also imputed values which may contribute to bias and unintended consequences on regression. This was done used additive regression, bootstrapping, and predictive mean matching used the "Hmisc" package in R studio. The raw data set contained approximately one million observations.

We will expand our enhancement to go beyond the variables used in the original analysis. The data which is publicly available from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics has over 23 attributes, but for the sake of simplicity the original authors have kept the eight regressors and the response variable of departure delay (`DepDelay`). The process by which they choose which regressors is not fully elaborated on in the original analysis, so we will validate that the regressors that they selected are the best to use to construct an MLR model. 


### Extension/enhancement to implement

We will start cleaning the dataset to remove miscellaneous information that has no impact on flight delay, such as flight duration and destinations. 

First, we will address non-normality of the residual errors. We will delve into applying transformations (potentially log) onto regressors and the response variable because of their right-skewed distribution. Once a normal distribution of errors has been achieved, we can draw inferences and perform tests that we would not have been able to do otherwise. No inferences or formal hypothesis testing was done to test the significance of the regressors. Since the variables are not correlated with each other, we can assume they are independent and do ANOVA testing without worrying about interacting terms. This would test the impact of each regressor on the model and analyze the amount of variation explained by the relationship with the regressor and response. The conclusions from these tests would give us a better understanding of the extent of which regressors influence flight delay.

Once we transform the necessary regressors, we will examine methods to find a better model based on a set of potential predictors. We want to explain as much variation as we can while using an adequate number of regressors according to the Principle of Parsimony.
